# Spring WebFlux Reactive Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **Reactive REST API** using **Spring WebFlux** and **Project Reactor**.  
It includes APIs for fetching all products and fetching a single product using **Flux** and **Mono**, providing a non-blocking, reactive programming model.

## Features
- Built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring WebFlux**
- Implements **Reactive Streams API**
- Uses **Flux** and **Mono** for asynchronous data handling
- REST endpoints for:
  - Fetching all products
  - Fetching a single product by ID
- Simple and modular project structure
